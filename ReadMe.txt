Random Quote Generator:

I built this project for the completion of Unit 1 of my Treehouse Techdegree assignments.

This project was built using standard JavaScript and no frameworks were used.

How it works:
	In the script.js file contains an array of objects that each store a quote and the source of that quote. 
Some of these quotes also have a citation, where the quote was found, and a date in which the quote was said. The
script pulls one of these quotes from the array and displays it in the browser. If a user pushes the "show another
quote" button, the program will select another quote from the array and replace the existing quote. Additionally,
the quotes are also set on a timer in which the quote will change automatically after 10 seconds.
